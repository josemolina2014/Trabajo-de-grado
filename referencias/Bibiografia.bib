abstract = {One of the major aims of this book is to improve collaboration between the people responsible for delivering software. In particular, we have in mind developers, testers, systems and database administrators, and managers. We cover topics from traditional configuration management, source code control, release planning, auditing, compliance, and integration to the automation of your building, testing, and deployment processes. We also describe techniques such as automated acceptance testing, dependency management, database migration, and the creation and management of testing and production environments. Many people involved in creating software consider these activities secondary to writing code. However, in our experience they take up a great deal of time and effort, and are critical to successful software delivery. When the risks surrounding these activities are not managed adequately, they can end up costing a lot of money, often more than the cost of building the software in the first place.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Bill is an IT manager at Parts Unlimited. It's Tuesday morning and on his drive into the office, Bill gets a call from the CEO. The company's new IT initiative, code named Phoenix Project, is critical to the future of Parts Unlimited, but the project is massively over budget and very late. The CEO wants Bill to report directly to him and fix the mess in ninety days or else Bill's entire department will be outsourced. With the help of a prospective board member and his mysterious philosophy of The Three Ways, Bill starts to see that IT work has more in common with manufacturing plant work than he ever imagined. With the clock ticking, Bill must organize work flow, streamline interdepartmental communications, and effectively serve the other business functions at Parts Unlimited. In a fast-paced and entertaining style, three luminaries of the DevOps movement deliver a story that anyone who works in IT will recognize. Readers will not only learn how to improve their own IT organizations, they'll never view IT the same way again.},

abstract = {Includes index. Your answer to the software project management gap The Complete Software Project Manager: From Planning to Launch and Beyond addresses an interesting problem experienced by today's project managers: they are often leading software projects, but have no background in technology. To close this gap in experience and help you improve your software project management skills, this essential text covers key topics, including: how to understand software development and why it is so difficult, how to plan a project, choose technology platforms, and develop project specifications, how to staff a project, how to develop a budget, test software development progress, and troubleshoot problems, and what to do when it all goes wrong. Real-life examples, hints, and management tools help you apply these new ideas, and lists of red flags, danger signals, and things to avoid at all costs assist in keeping your project on track. Companies have, due to the nature of the competitive environment, been somewhat forced to adopt new technologies. Oftentimes, the professionals leading the development of these technologies do not have any experience in the tech field-and this can cause problems. To improve efficiency and effectiveness, this groundbreaking book offers guidance to professionals who need a crash course in software project management.-Review the basics of software project management, and dig into the more complicated topics that guide you in developing an effective management approach -Avoid common pitfalls by perusing red flags, danger signals, and things to avoid at all costs -Leverage practical roadmaps, charts, and step-by-step processes -Explore real-world examples to see effective software project management in action The Complete Software Project Manager: From Planning to Launch and Beyond is a fundamental resource for professionals who are leading software projects but do not have a background in technology.

abstract = {Requirements engineering (RE) tools are increasingly used to ease the RE processes and allow for more systematic and formalized handling of requirements, change management and traceability. For developers and companies evaluating the use of RE tools it is thus essential to know which RE processes are supported by tools and how they fit to their own priorities. The answer isn't easy because many sales prospects highlight numerous featuresyet leave out to which degree they're supported and whether all features really matter. To gain insight into how current RE tools adapt to RE activities, we ran a 146-item survey based on the features covered by the ISO/IEC TR 24766:2009, a new framework for assessing RE tool capabilities. We received responses from 37 participants, covering all relevant tools. In addition to the tools' score in each activity, we assessed their performance in three concrete use scenarios. Our findings can help practitioners select an RE tool as well as provide areas for improvement for RE tools developers. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {The First Complete Guide to DevOps for Software Architects DevOps promises to accelerate the release of new software features and improve monitoring of systems in production, but its crucial implications for software architects and architecture are often ignored. In DevOps: A Software Architect's Perspective, three leading architects address these issues head-on. The authors review decisions software architects must make in order to achieve DevOps' goals and clarify how other DevOps participants are likely to impact the architect's work. They also provide the organizational, technical, and operational context needed to deploy DevOps more efficiently, and review DevOps' impact on each development phase. The authors address cross-cutting concerns that link multiple functions, offering practical insights into compliance, performance, reliability, repeatability, and security. This guide demonstrates the authors' ideas in action with three real-world case studies: datacenter replication for business continuity, management of a continuous deployment pipeline, and migration to a microservice architecture. Comprehensive coverage includes • Why DevOps can require major changes in both system architecture and IT roles • How virtualization and the cloud can enable DevOps practices • Integrating operations and its service lifecycle into DevOps • Designing new systems to work well with DevOps practices • Integrating DevOps with agile methods and TDD • Handling failure detection, upgrade planning, and other key issues • Managing consistency issues arising from DevOps' independent deployment models • Integrating security controls, roles, and audits into DevOps • Preparing a business plan for DevOps adoption, rollout, and measurement},

abstract = {The DevOps Adoption Playbook provides practical, actionable, real-world guidance on implementing DevOps at enterprise scale. Author Sanjeev Sharma heads the DevOps practice for IBM; in this book, he provides unique guidance and insight on implementing DevOps at large organizations. Most DevOps literature is aimed at startups, but enterprises have unique needs, capabilities, limitations, and challenges; "DevOps for startups" doesn't work at this scale, but the DevOps paradigm can revolutionize enterprise IT. Deliver high-value applications and systems with velocity and agility by adopting the necessary practices, automation tools, and organizational and cultural changes that lead to innovation through rapid experimentation. Speed is an advantage in the face of competition, but it must never come at the expense of quality; DevOps allows your organization to keep both by intersecting development, quality assurance, and operations. Enterprise-level DevOps comes with its own set of challenges, but this book shows you just how easily they are overcome. With a slight shift in perspective, your organization can stay ahead of the competition while keeping costs, risks, and quality under control. •Grasp the full extent of the DevOps impact on IT organizations •Achieve high-value innovation and optimization with low cost and risk •Exceed traditional business goals with higher product release efficiency •Implement DevOps in large-scale enterprise IT environments DevOps has been one of IT's hottest trends for the past decade, and plenty of success stories testify to its effectiveness in organizations of any size, industry, or level of IT maturity, all around the world. The DevOps Adoption Playbook shows you how to get your organization on board so you can slip production into the fast lane and innovate your way to the top.},

abstract = {Context: There is a significant number of requirements engineering (RE) tools with different features and prices. However, existing RE tool lists do not provide detailed information about the features of the tools that they catalogue. It would therefore be interesting for both practitioners and tool developers to be aware of the state-of-the-art as regards RE tools. Objective: This paper presents the results of a survey answered by RE tool vendors. The purpose of the survey was to gain an insight into how current RE tools support the RE process by means of concrete capabilities, and to what degree. Method: The ISO/IEC TR 24766:2009 is a framework for assessing RE tools' capabilities. A 146-item questionnaire based principally on the features covered by this international guideline was sent to major tool vendors worldwide. A descriptive statistical study was then carried out to provide comparability, and bivariate correlation tests were also applied to measure the association between different variables. A sample of the tools was subjected to neutral assessment and an interrater reliability analysis was performed to ensure the reliability of the results. Results: The 38 participants sent back their answers. Most tools are delivered under a proprietary license, and their licenses are not free. A growing number of them facilitate Web access. Moreover, requirements elicitation exemplifies the best supported category of features in this study, whereas requirements modeling and management are the most badly supported categories. Conclusion: The RE process seems to be well covered by current RE tools, but there is still a certain margin for amelioration, principally with regard to requirements modeling, open data model and data integration features. These subjects represent areas for improvement for RE tool developers. Practitioners might also obtain useful ideas from the study to be taken into account when selecting an appropriate RE tool to be successfully applied to their work. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {| 1 W hitepapers "Software is eating the world." 1 Software is pervasive; it influences every aspect of our modern world. It enables organizations to deliver better products, faster and with higher quality. It enables organizations to create new, smarter products that deliver better customer outcomes. It also enables organizations to better understand user needs to become better at delivering better outcomes. Software is also the source of disruption. Organizations who can use it to adapt and evolve faster out-perform their non-digital counterparts. 2 The formula is simple, yet hard to embrace: organizations that harness the power of software master rapid empiricism, the ability to quickly form hypotheses, try them, gather and analyze the results of these experiments, and use the information to improve. The world is changing at an increasingly faster rate, driven by the increased velocity of technology, markets and climate change. 3 The only way to respond, survive, and thrive is to embrace the change and become better at turning it into an advantage. Two Movements, One Goal Agile and DevOps are the primary means by which organizations are driving these changes. They share much in common: faster delivery cycles, smaller increments (or batches) of releases, using feedback to improve, removing waste and impediments. Their emphasis varies, and this sometimes leads people to believe that they are different things. Agile emphasizes team interactions, culture, and values, while DevOps emphasizes delivery pipelines and flow. But, Agile is also concerned with automation, and DevOps is also concerned with communication and culture.},

A literature survey has carried out to explore about current DevOps practices in industry. According to the literature survey, the conceptual research model was developed and five hypotheses were derived. Research objectives were accomplished by testing hypotheses using Pearson correlation. A linear model is derived based on the linear regression analysis. An online questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data whereas interviews with experts on DevOps and Quality assurance have been used to identify how to improve the quality of software by practicing DevOps. Recommendations are given based on interview feedback, hypotheses testing with regression analysis. According to the quantitative study, researchers have identified that quality of the software gets improved when practice DevOps by following CAMS (Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing) framework. Automation is the most critical factor to improve the software quality. As per the results of multiple regression analysis, it has proved culture, automation, measurement and sharing are important factors to consider to improve quality of the software. In conclusion it can be recommended to use DevOps to achieve high quality software.},

The identification and selection of an appropriate requirements management tool can be a costly, time-consuming, and error-prone undertaking especially in the context of software product line requirements management, requiring the tools to support both product and platform development activities that often involve geographically distributed, collaborating, and competing stakeholders. Criteria lists have been developed to facilitate the selection. This research (1) creates an evaluation framework to review the applicability of the lists for the selection of requirements management tools supporting distributed collaboration and software product line requirements management and (2) leverages the framework to perform the evaluation. The lists are found to provide little support for evaluating the tools from the viewpoints of distributed collaboration and software product line requirements management. Future research is needed to create a more comprehensive list addressing these viewpoints.},

abstract = {By the early 1990s the need for reengineering legacy systems was already acute, but recently the demand has increased significantly with the shift toward web-based user interfaces. The demand by all business sectors to adapt their information systems to the Web has created a tremendous need for methods, tools, and infrastructures to evolve and exploit existing applications efficiently and cost-effectively. Reverse engineering has been heralded as one of the most promising technologies to combat this.legacy systems problem. This paper presents a roadmap for reverse engineering research for the first decade of the new millennium, building on the program comprehension theories of the 1980s and the reverse engineering technology of the 1990s.},

abstract = {Requirements engineering (RE) tools are increasingly used to ease the RE processes and allow for more systematic and formalized handling of requirements, change management and traceability. For developers and companies evaluating the use of RE tools it is thus essential to know which RE processes are supported by tools and how they fit to their own priorities. The answer isn't easy because many sales prospects highlight numerous featuresyet leave out to which degree they're supported and whether all features really matter. To gain insight into how current RE tools adapt to RE activities, we ran a 146-item survey based on the features covered by the ISO/IEC TR 24766:2009, a new framework for assessing RE tool capabilities. We received responses from 37 participants, covering all relevant tools. In addition to the tools' score in each activity, we assessed their performance in three concrete use scenarios. Our findings can help practitioners select an RE tool as well as provide areas for improvement for RE tools developers. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Legacy systems are a challenge for the operations of modern organizations as they limit the growth of business and their changing ability. However, they are often systems suited to their purpose, they deliver the expected value and investment in them is justifiable. The concept of DevOps has come to reduce the separation between development and operations teams in software development companies, decreasing the product lifecycle. With this concept comes the practice of continuous delivery, allowing teams to deliver and deploy any version of their software in any computing environment at any time through a fully automated process. This practice improves the feedback of the development process, so problems could be identified and resolved as early as possible. In this paper, we present an experience of deploying DevOps, and propose a structured process for deploying DevOps and its modifications necessary to adapt to legacy systems in order to the delivery process of the legacy systems has a short and high quality lifecycle, delivering frequent versions in an automated way.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We present evidence for stochastic star formation histories in low-mass (M* < 10^10 Msun) galaxies from observations within the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. For $\sim$73,000 galaxies between 0.05<z<0.32, we calculate star formation rates (SFR) and specific star formation rates (SSFR = SFR/M*) from spectroscopic Halpha measurements and apply dust corrections derived from Balmer decrements. We find a dependence of SSFR on stellar mass, such that SSFRs decrease with increasing stellar mass for star-forming galaxies, and for the full sample, SSFRs decrease as a stronger function of stellar mass. We use simple parametrizations of exponentially declining star formation histories to investigate the dependence on stellar mass of the star formation timescale and the formation redshift. We find that parametrizations previously fit to samples of z$\sim$1 galaxies cannot recover the distributions of SSFRs and stellar masses observed in the GAMA sample between 0.05<z<0.32. In particular, a large number of low-mass (M* < 10^10 Msun) galaxies are observed to have much higher SSFRs than can be explained by these simple models over the redshift range of 0.05<z<0.32, even when invoking mass-dependent staged evolution. For such a large number of galaxies to maintain low stellar masses, yet harbour such high SSFRs, requires the late onset of a weak underlying exponentially declining SFH with stochastic bursts of star formation superimposed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) in acceleration of burn wound healing. METHODS: Thirty three severe burn patients were enrolled in this study and randomly divided into rhGH group (n = 18) and placebo control group (n = 15). The rhGH was administered subcutaneously in the dose of 0.1 mg . kg(-1) at 10 pm every evening in rhGH group for 14 days, while normal saline was used as a placebo in the control group. The serum concentration of GH and IGF-1 were assayed with ELISA method, and the proliferation index (PI) and S-phase fraction (SPF) of wound tissue was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). The expression of PCNA, EGFR and CK was assessed by immunohistochemical stains. RESULTS: Serum concentrations of GH and IFG-1 increased significantly after rhGH administration. The PI and SPF of wound tissue were obviously higher than those before rhGH administration and those in the control group. The expressions of PCNA, EGFR and CK was enhanced. In addition, the epidermis of healed wound was thicker in rhGH group than that in the control group. CONCLUSION: The application of rhGH in burn patients could improve the serum concentration of GH and IFG-1, promote DNA synthesis and PCNA and EFGR expression of epithelium, so that re-epithelialization of the burn wound could be accelerated.},

abstract = {DevOps es un t{\'{e}}rmino relativamente nuevo que apareci{\'{o}} por primera vez en 2009, sin embargo, empresas tales como Etsy, Facebook, Amazon o Netflix son l{\'{i}}deres en la implementaci{\'{o}}n del nuevo paradigma. En este trabajo se presentan un conjunto de lineamientos para la implementaci{\'{o}}n  del modelo CALMS (DevOps) en MIPyMEs  de desarrollo de Software en el contexto Sur Colombiano. Se presenta un modelo que tiene en cuenta los aspectos t{\'{e}}cnicos y organizacionales logrando un ambiente de desarrollo novedoso que permite la integraci{\'{o}}n de DevOps al contexto del desarrollo de software colombiano. El modelo fue probado en una empresa MIPyME y los resultados son alentadores. Se pas{\'{o}} de hacer 1 despliegue semanal a 1 despliegue diario y de los 20 despliegues que se hicieron en total, 16 fueron puestos exitosamente en producci{\'{o}}n. Finalmente discutimos como DevOps puede incrementar la productividad de las organizaciones de desarrollo de software y como la implementaci{\'{o}}n de los lineamientos en un ambiente integrado y probado puede incrementar la competitividad de las empresas de software en un mercado globalizado.},
