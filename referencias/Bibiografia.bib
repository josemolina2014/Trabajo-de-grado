abstract = {The First Complete Guide to DevOps for Software Architects DevOps promises to accelerate the release of new software features and improve monitoring of systems in production, but its crucial implications for software architects and architecture are often ignored. In DevOps: A Software Architect's Perspective, three leading architects address these issues head-on. The authors review decisions software architects must make in order to achieve DevOps' goals and clarify how other DevOps participants are likely to impact the architect's work. They also provide the organizational, technical, and operational context needed to deploy DevOps more efficiently, and review DevOps' impact on each development phase. The authors address cross-cutting concerns that link multiple functions, offering practical insights into compliance, performance, reliability, repeatability, and security. This guide demonstrates the authors' ideas in action with three real-world case studies: datacenter replication for business continuity, management of a continuous deployment pipeline, and migration to a microservice architecture. Comprehensive coverage includes • Why DevOps can require major changes in both system architecture and IT roles • How virtualization and the cloud can enable DevOps practices • Integrating operations and its service lifecycle into DevOps • Designing new systems to work well with DevOps practices • Integrating DevOps with agile methods and TDD • Handling failure detection, upgrade planning, and other key issues • Managing consistency issues arising from DevOps' independent deployment models • Integrating security controls, roles, and audits into DevOps • Preparing a business plan for DevOps adoption, rollout, and measurement},

abstract = {Legacy systems are a challenge for the operations of modern organizations as they limit the growth of business and their changing ability. However, they are often systems suited to their purpose, they deliver the expected value and investment in them is justifiable. The concept of DevOps has come to reduce the separation between development and operations teams in software development companies, decreasing the product lifecycle. With this concept comes the practice of continuous delivery, allowing teams to deliver and deploy any version of their software in any computing environment at any time through a fully automated process. This practice improves the feedback of the development process, so problems could be identified and resolved as early as possible. In this paper, we present an experience of deploying DevOps, and propose a structured process for deploying DevOps and its modifications necessary to adapt to legacy systems in order to the delivery process of the legacy systems has a short and high quality lifecycle, delivering frequent versions in an automated way.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

We also describe techniques such as automated acceptance testing, dependency management, database migration, and the creation and management of testing and production environments. Many people involved in creating software consider these activities secondary to writing code. However, in our experience they take up a great deal of time and effort, and are critical to successful software delivery. When the risks surrounding these activities are not managed adequately, they can end up costing a lot of money, often more than the cost of building the software in the first place.},

abstract = {| 1 W hitepapers "Software is eating the world." 1 Software is pervasive; it influences every aspect of our modern world. It enables organizations to deliver better products, faster and with higher quality. It enables organizations to create new, smarter products that deliver better customer outcomes. It also enables organizations to better understand user needs to become better at delivering better outcomes. Software is also the source of disruption. Organizations who can use it to adapt and evolve faster out-perform their non-digital counterparts. 2 The formula is simple, yet hard to embrace: organizations that harness the power of software master rapid empiricism, the ability to quickly form hypotheses, try them, gather and analyze the results of these experiments, and use the information to improve. The world is changing at an increasingly faster rate, driven by the increased velocity of technology, markets and climate change. 3 The only way to respond, survive, and thrive is to embrace the change and become better at turning it into an advantage. Two Movements, One Goal Agile and DevOps are the primary means by which organizations are driving these changes. They share much in common: faster delivery cycles, smaller increments (or batches) of releases, using feedback to improve, removing waste and impediments. Their emphasis varies, and this sometimes leads people to believe that they are different things. Agile emphasizes team interactions, culture, and values, while DevOps emphasizes delivery pipelines and flow. But, Agile is also concerned with automation, and DevOps is also concerned with communication and culture.},

In an attempt to bridge this gap, a DevOps Competence Model showing an overview of the areas to be considered in adopting DevOps is proposed. Also, a DevOps Maturity Model is proposed that presents a growth path for software producing organizations. Both these models incorporate perspectives that are made up of focus areas which in turn are made up of capabilities. Apart from designing and validating these models by means of expert workshops, a case study has been conducted where assessees answered questions to gain insight into which capabilities were implemented. From the answers, maturity profiles were extracted that supported the assessees in becoming more DevOps mature.},

The main purpose of this paper is to conduct a study on how DevOps practice has impacted to software quality. The secondary objective is to find how to improve quality efficiently. A literature survey has carried out to explore about current DevOps practices in industry. According to the literature survey, the conceptual research model was developed and five hypotheses were derived. Research objectives were accomplished by testing hypotheses using Pearson correlation. A linear model is derived based on the linear regression analysis. An online questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data whereas interviews with experts on DevOps and Quality assurance have been used to identify how to improve the quality of software by practicing DevOps. Recommendations are given based on interview feedback, hypotheses testing with regression analysis. According to the quantitative study, researchers have identified that quality of the software gets improved when practice DevOps by following CAMS (Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing) framework. Automation is the most critical factor to improve the software quality. As per the results of multiple regression analysis, it has proved culture, automation, measurement and sharing are important factors to consider to improve quality of the software. In conclusion it can be recommended to use DevOps to achieve high quality software.},

abstract = {Quality pressure is one of the factors affecting processes for software development in its various stages. DevOps is one of the proposed solutions to such pressure. The primary focus of DevOps is to increase the deployment speed, frequency and quality. DevOps is a mixture of different developments and operations to its multitudinous ramifications in software development industries, DevOps have attracted the interest of many researchers. There are considerable literature surveys on this critical innovation in software development, yet, little attention has been given to DevOps impact on software quality. This research is aimed at analyzing the implications of DevOps features on software quality. DevOps can also be referred to a change in organization cultures aimed at removal of gaps between the development and operations of an organization. The adoption of DevOps in an organization provides many benefits including quality but also brings challenges to an organization. This study presents systematic mapping of the impact of DevOps on software quality. The results of this study provide a better understanding of DevOps on software quality for both professionals and researchers working in this area. The study shows research was mainly focused in automation, culture, continuous delivery, fast feedback of DevOps. There is need of further research in many areas of DevOps (for instance: measurement, development of metrics of different stages to assess its performance, culture, practices toward ensuring quality assurance, and quality factors such as usability, efficiency, software maintainability and portability).},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Trends in DevOps: a systematic mapping of the literature Abstract: DevOps has become an approach of great relevance for software development, which arises with the objective of accelerating and increasing productivity in the development of software products and services, facilitating automation, integration and continuous deployment. This article presents the results of a systematic mapping carried out with the objective of knowing the state of the art of DevOps definition and proposed solutions for adoption in software companies. The results show that there is little detailed information about activities, tasks, roles and other important process elements to facilitate the DevOps adoption.},

@book{Ravichandran2016,
abstract = {We present evidence for stochastic star formation histories in low-mass (M* < 10^10 Msun) galaxies from observations within the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. For $\sim$73,000 galaxies between 0.05<z<0.32, we calculate star formation rates (SFR) and specific star formation rates (SSFR = SFR/M*) from spectroscopic Halpha measurements and apply dust corrections derived from Balmer decrements. We find a dependence of SSFR on stellar mass, such that SSFRs decrease with increasing stellar mass for star-forming galaxies, and for the full sample, SSFRs decrease as a stronger function of stellar mass. We use simple parametrizations of exponentially declining star formation histories to investigate the dependence on stellar mass of the star formation timescale and the formation redshift. We find that parametrizations previously fit to samples of z$\sim$1 galaxies cannot recover the distributions of SSFRs and stellar masses observed in the GAMA sample between 0.05<z<0.32. In particular, a large number of low-mass (M* < 10^10 Msun) galaxies are observed to have much higher SSFRs than can be explained by these simple models over the redshift range of 0.05<z<0.32, even when invoking mass-dependent staged evolution. For such a large number of galaxies to maintain low stellar masses, yet harbour such high SSFRs, requires the late onset of a weak underlying exponentially declining SFH with stochastic bursts of star formation superimposed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) in acceleration of burn wound healing. METHODS: Thirty three severe burn patients were enrolled in this study and randomly divided into rhGH group (n = 18) and placebo control group (n = 15). The rhGH was administered subcutaneously in the dose of 0.1 mg . kg(-1) at 10 pm every evening in rhGH group for 14 days, while normal saline was used as a placebo in the control group. The serum concentration of GH and IGF-1 were assayed with ELISA method, and the proliferation index (PI) and S-phase fraction (SPF) of wound tissue was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). The expression of PCNA, EGFR and CK was assessed by immunohistochemical stains. RESULTS: Serum concentrations of GH and IFG-1 increased significantly after rhGH administration. The PI and SPF of wound tissue were obviously higher than those before rhGH administration and those in the control group. The expressions of PCNA, EGFR and CK was enhanced. In addition, the epidermis of healed wound was thicker in rhGH group than that in the control group. CONCLUSION: The application of rhGH in burn patients could improve the serum concentration of GH and IFG-1, promote DNA synthesis and PCNA and EFGR expression of epithelium, so that re-epithelialization of the burn wound could be accelerated.},
